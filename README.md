# Walmart Analysis
The data set for this project was acquired from https://www.kaggle.com and the task of the
project is to predict the weekly sales for various Walmart Stores. A brief description of the data
is given below;

The data contains the historical sales for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. The
aim is to predict the total weekly sales for each store.
Putting into consideration, the dataset shows that Walmart runs several promotional
markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four
largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.

Described below are the files given for this prediction;

and size of store.

This csv file contains 421570 records.

test.csv - This file is identical to train.csv, but has the predictions of the sales which covers from
2012-11-02 to 2013-11-01.

activity for the given dates. It contains the following fields: Store, Date Temperature,
